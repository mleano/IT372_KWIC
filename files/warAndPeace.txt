well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the
buonapartes but i warn you if you dont tell me that this means war
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by
that antichrist i really believe he is antichrist i will have
nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer
my faithful slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see
i have frightened you sit down and tell me all the news
it was in july 1805 and the speaker was the wellknown anna
pavlovna scherer maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya
fedorovna with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man
of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her
reception anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days she was as
she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in
st petersburg used only by the elite
all her invitations without exception written in french and
delivered by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows
if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too
terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10
annette scherer
heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the
least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing
an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had
stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke
in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but
thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a
man of importance who had grown old in society and at court he went
up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald
scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the
sofa
first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your friends
mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the
politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even
irony could be discerned
can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times
like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are
staying the whole evening i hope
and the fete at the english ambassadors today is wednesday i
must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is
coming for me to take me there
i thought todays fete had been canceled i confess all these
festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome
if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would
have been put off said the prince who like a woundup clock by
force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed
dont tease well and what has been decided about novosiltsevs
dispatch you know everything
what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold
listless tone what has been decided they have decided that
buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to
burn ours
prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a
stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty
years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an
enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she
did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to
disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile
which though it did not suit her faded features always played
round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual
consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor
could nor considered it necessary to correct
in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna
burst out
oh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understand
things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war
she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious
sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is
the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to
perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble
that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and
crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than
ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must
avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely
on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot
understand the emperor alexanders loftiness of soul she has
refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some
secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none
the english have not understood and cannot understand the
selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only
desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and
what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has
always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe
is powerless before him and i dont believe a word that hardenburg
says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a
trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored
monarch he will save europe
she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity
i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been
sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the
king of prussias consent by assault you are so eloquent will you
give me a cup of tea
in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am
expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart
who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of
the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good
ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he
has been received by the emperor had you heard
i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me
he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred
to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive
of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke
to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts
is a poor creature
prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others
were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it
for the baron
anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she
nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or
was pleased with
baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her
sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone
as she named the empress anna pavlovnas face suddenly assumed an
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron
funke beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadness
the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the
womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna
pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of
a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him
so she said
now about your family do you know that since your daughter came
out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly
beautiful
the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude
i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer
to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that
political and social topics were ended and the time had come for
intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the
joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid
children i dont speak of anatole your youngest i dont like
him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her
eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate
them less than anyone and so you dont deserve to have them
and she smiled her ecstatic smile
i cant help it said the prince lavater would have said i
lack the bump of paternity
dont joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i
am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her
face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her
majestys and you were pitied
the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly
awaiting a reply he frowned
what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all
a father could for their education and they have both turned out
fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active
one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling
in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles
round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse
and unpleasant
and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a
father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna
pavlovna looking up pensively
i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my
children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that
is how i explain it to myself it cant be helped
he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
gesture anna pavlovna meditated
have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole
she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and
though i dont feel that weakness in myself as yeti know a little
person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of
yours princess mary bolkonskaya
prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory
and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a
movement of the head that he was considering this information
do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand
rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in
five years if he goes on like this presently he added thats what
we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich
her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he
is the wellknown prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army
under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is
very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very
unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise
meinen lately he is an aidedecamp of kutuzovs and will be here
tonight
listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna
pavlovnas hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange
that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave
slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she
is rich and of good family and thats all i want
and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised
the maid of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and
fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction
attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting ill speak to lise
young bolkonskis wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can
be arranged it shall be on your familys behalf that ill start my
apprenticeship as old maid
anna pavlovnas drawing room was gradually filling the highest
petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged
prince vasilis daughter the beautiful helene came to take her
father to the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and
her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess
bolkonskaya known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg was
also there she had been married during the previous winter and being
pregnant did not go to any large gatherings but only to small
receptions prince vasilis son hippolyte had come with mortemart
whom he introduced the abbe morio and many others had also come
the most fascinating woman in petersburg
to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my
aunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or
her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who
had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to
arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna
pavlovna mentioned each ones name and then left them
each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom
not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of
them cared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful
and solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of
them in the same words about their health and her own and the health
of her majesty who thank god was better today and each
visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left
the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious
duty and did not return to her the whole evening
the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a
goldembroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a
delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her
teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming
when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always
the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect the shortness
of her upper lip and her halfopen mouth seemed to be her own special
and peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of
this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life
and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull
dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company
and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were
becoming like her full of life and health all who talked to her
and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her
white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that
day
the little princess went round the table with quick short
swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her
dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was
doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought
my work said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all
present mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick
on me she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to
be quite a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed
and she spread out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed
dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast
soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone
else replied anna pavlovna
you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going
to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she
added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer she
turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helene
what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince
vasili to anna pavlovna
one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with
closecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionable
at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout
young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a wellknown
grandee of catherines time who now lay dying in moscow the young man
had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had
only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this
was his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with
the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room
but in spite of this lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and
fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the
place came over her face when she saw pierre enter though he was
certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety
could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant
and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else
in that drawing room
it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor
invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her
aunt as she conducted him to her
pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look
round as if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to
the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate
acquaintance
anna pavlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majestys health
anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know
the abbe morio he is a most interesting man
yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very
interesting but hardly feasible
you think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and
get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now
committed a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady
before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak
to another who wished to get away with his head bent and his big
feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the
abbes plan chimerical
we will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smile
and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave
she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch
ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to
flag as the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands
to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or
there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and
hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so anna
pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a
toonoisy group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the
conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion but amid
these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident she kept an
anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to
listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to
another group whose center was the abbe
pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna
pavlovnas was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all
the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like
a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of
missing any clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the
selfconfident and refined expression on the faces of those present he
was always expecting to hear something very profound at last he
came up to morio here the conversation seemed interesting and he
stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young
people are fond of doing
anna pavlovnas reception was in full swing the spindles hummed
steadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the aunt
beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face
was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company
had settled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed
round the abbe another of young people was grouped round the
beautiful princess helene prince vasilis daughter and the little
princess bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plump
for her age the third group was gathered round mortemart and anna
pavlovna
the vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and
polished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out
of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
which he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up
as a treat to her guests as a clever maitre dhotel serves up as a
specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen
it in the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna served
up to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarly
choice morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing
the murder of the duc denghien the vicomte said that the duc
denghien had perished by his own magnanimity and that there were
particular reasons for buonapartes hatred of him
ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pavlovna
with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in
the sound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomte
the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness
to comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone
to listen to his tale
the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to of
the guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she to
another how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to a
third and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
and most advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef
on a hot dish
the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile
come over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to the
beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center of
another group
the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with
which she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectly
beautiful woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed
with moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and
sparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for her
not looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciously
allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and
shapely shoulders back and bosom which in the fashion of those days
were very much exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of a
ballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna helene was so
lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but on
the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too
victorious beauty she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish
its effect
how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted
his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something
extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also
with her unchanging smile
madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said he
smilingly inclining his head
the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and
considered a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the
story was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful
round arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her
still more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond
necklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and
whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at
once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honors
face and again relapsed into her radiant smile
the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene
wait a moment ill get my work now then what are you thinking
of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag
there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in
her seat
now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she
took up her work
prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle
and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her
le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary
resemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that
in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features
were like his sisters but while in her case everything was lit up by
a joyous selfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation
and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the
contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of
sullen selfconfidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes
nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace
and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions
its not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside
the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak
why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging
his shoulders
because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone
which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
had uttered them
he spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be
sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was
dressed in a darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of
cuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings
the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then
current to the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to
paris to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon
bonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in
his presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits
to which he was subject and was thus at the ducs mercy the latter
spared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by
death
the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point
where the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies
looked agitated
charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the
little princess
charming whispered the little princess sticking the needle
into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of
the story prevented her from going on with it
the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he
was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to
the rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe
about the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by
the young mans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet
theory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally
which was why anna pavlovna disapproved
the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights of
the people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for one
powerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to place
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its
object the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would
save the world
but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning
at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely at
pierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate the
italians face instantly changed and assumed an offensively
affected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversing
with women
i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society more especially of the feminine society in which i have
had the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think
of the climate said he
not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the more
conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the
larger circle
just them another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew
bolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome
young man of medium height with firm clearcut features
everything about him from his weary bored expression to his quiet
measured step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little
wife it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing
room but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look
at or listen to them and among all these faces that he found so
tedious none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife
he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome
face kissed anna pavlovnas hand and screwing up his eyes scanned
the whole company
you are off to the war prince said anna pavlovna
general kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressing the
last syllable of the generals name like a frenchman has been
pleased to take me as an aidedecamp
and lise your wife
she will go to the country
are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife
andre said his wife addressing her husband in the same
coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has
been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte
prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who
from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with
glad affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he
looked round prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance
with whoever was touching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming
face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile
there now so you too are in the great world said he to
pierre
i knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper
with you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
vicomte who was continuing his story
no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing pierres
hand to show that there was no need to ask the question he wished
to say something more but at that moment prince vasili and his
daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass
you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the
frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent
his rising this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me
of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to
leave your enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovna
his daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly
holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous
almost frightened eyes as she passed him
very lovely said prince andrew
very said pierre
in passing prince vasili seized pierres hand and said to anna
pavlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a
whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society
nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever
